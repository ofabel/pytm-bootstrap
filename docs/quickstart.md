# Quickstart

To create your first exercise, open your Python project folder (where your virtual environment folder is located) in
your favourite IDE and create a new file named `app.py` with the following content:

```python
from src import Exercise

app = Exercise()
```

Next to the `app.py` file, create a new folder with the name `src`.
