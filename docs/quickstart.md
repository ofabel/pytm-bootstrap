# Quickstart

This page should give you a quick introduction into the library and allow you to start coding right away. If you are new
to the _Python Tool Manager_ it's recommended you start with the {doc}`user's guide </users-guide>` instead.
Otherwise, we recommend you to check out the [skeleton repository](https://github.com/ofabel/pytm-skeleton) on GitHub.
